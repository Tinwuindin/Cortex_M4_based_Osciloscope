# Expected
It should be (at least in my mind):
* a simple osciloscope with 100kHz of max freq sample for every type of signals 
* at least 1MHz of clk signals (square with only 2 states)
* include a simple wave generator

This is the frist prototype, the end can be able to be ported to a BLE MCU based (i got in the eye the STM32WB55xxx with my pcb design)
